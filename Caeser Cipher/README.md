This problem set has two parts. The first part allows you to practice thinking about
problems in a recursive fashion, taking advantage of the idea that one can reduce
the problem to a simpler version of the same problem. In ​ ps4a.py​ , you will write a
recursive function that takes as input a string and figures out all the possible
reorderings of the characters in the string.


The second part will give you experience in thinking about problems in terms of
classes, each instance of which contains specific attributes as well as methods for
manipulating them. In ​ ps4b.py​ , you will use object-oriented programming to write
a Caesar/shift cipher. In ps4c.py
, you will use object-oriented programming to
write a very simple substitution cipher.
